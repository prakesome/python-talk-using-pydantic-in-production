# Things to keep in mind

Pydantic is not a static type system. It sometimes might feel like it. Don't fall for the trap. You are still bound by Python's dynamic type system.


See the code below.


```  python

from datetime import datetime

from Typing import Optional

from pydantic import (
    BaseModel,
    Field.
    field_validator,
    ValidationError
)


class InvoicePaymentStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")
    invoice_paid: bool = Field(alias="invoicePaid")
    invoice_paid_date: Optional[datetime] = Field(alias="invoicePaidDate")


# a type hint!
response: InvoicePaymentStatusResponse = InvoicePaymentStatusResponse(
    invoice_id=123, # only these values have type enforcement
    invoice_paid=False
)

# no protection!
response = {}

```
