#  You want to define data structures as contracts

I work with a lot of APIs. Pydantic allows me to define the request and response data structures in a self contained manner. 


``` python
from datetime import datetime

from Typing import Optional

from pydantic import (
    BaseModel,
    Field.
    field_validator,
    ValidationError
)

class CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")


class InvoicePaymentStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")
    invoice_paid: bool = Field(alias="invoicePaid")
    invoice_paid_date: Optional[datetime] = Field(alias="invoicePaidDate")
    
```


The code above defines and exposes the intent the code, the types of data it expects, and the JSON level naming convention of the fields.


For the request class, the JSON would look like:

``` python

class CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")

{
    "invoiceId": 123
}
```

The response class:


``` python
class InvoicePaymentStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")
    invoice_paid: bool = Field(alias="invoicePaid")
    invoice_paid_date: datetime = Field(alias="invoicePaidDate")


{
    "invoiceId": 123,
    "invoicePaid: false
}

# OR IF PAID

{
    "invoiceId": 123,
    "invoicePaid": true,
    "invoicePaidDate": "2023-10-05T12:12:20Z:
}
```
