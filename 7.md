# You want to write less lower level unit tests

Given that validation is being done by Pydantic, you can test whatever logic you may have without the need to test the data structure itself too much.

```  python
import pytest


def test_check_if_invoice_is_paid_request_model_validates_invoice_id_is_more_than_zero():

    from models import CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest

    invoice_id = 456
    request = CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(invoice_id=invoice_id)
    assert request.invoice_id == invoice_id

def test_check_if_invoice_is_paid_request_model_throws_exception_when_invoice_id_for_incorrect_type():

    from models import CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest

    invoice_id = "999-000-4567-12345"
    
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        request = CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(invoice_id=invoice_id)

```

The rest of the tests can focus on the code that mutates state rather than on data structures.
