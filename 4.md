# You want to have validation at object instance 

Let's take the ckass from the previous slide.

``` python

class CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")
```

When the class is instanced, Pydantic will validate the type and the key.

``` python

# Instantiates
invoice = CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(invoice_id=123)


# Instantiates

request_data = {"invoiceId": 123}
invoice = CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(**request_data)

# Fails

invoice = CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(invoice_id="456")
```
