# What is Pydantic?

https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/ states that:

>Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python. Itenforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is invalid.


Think of it as a sort of static type system you can run on top of Python's dynamic type system.

Remember that the main difference between a static and dynamic type system is knowing the type of a variable at compile (interpretation) time.
