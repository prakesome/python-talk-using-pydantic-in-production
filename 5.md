# You need to run additional validation after an object is instanced but before it is accessed


Adding validation to the object is straightforward.


``` python

from pydantic import (
    BaseModel,
    Field.
    field_validator,
    ValidationError
)

class CheckIfInvoiceIsPaidRequest(BaseModel):
    invoice_id: int = Field(alias="invoiceId")

    @field_validator("invoice_id")
    def invoice_id_is_more_than_zero(cls, invoice_id):
        if invoice_id <= 0:
            raise ValidationError("invoice_id must be more than zero")
        return invoice_id
```
